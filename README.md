## SHINE Project 2020

# A Nonvoter Journey

This project was completed as part of the AIGA DC SHINE Mentorship program. Under the mentorship of Johanna Ostrich, I created a project inspired by the program's theme of civic engagement. "A Nonvoter Journey" is a personal story of recognizing the importance of voting and civic duty in hopes of helping others see it's importance for themselves.
